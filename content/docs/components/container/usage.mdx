This component uses `tailwindcss` `max-w-*` utility classes to set the max width
of a component.

import { Container } from "@nature-ui/core";
```

## Usage

To contain any piece of content, wrap it in the `Container` component.

```jsx
<Container>
  There are many benefits to a joint design and development system. Not only
  does it bring benefits to the design team, but it also brings benefits to
  engineering teams. It makes sure that our experiences have a consistent look
  and feel, not just in our design specs, but in production
</Container>
```

### With size

The `size` prop accepts one of `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl` or any valid css
width property value.

```jsx
<Container size="sm" centered>
  There are many benefits to a joint design and development system. Not only
  does it bring benefits to the design team...
