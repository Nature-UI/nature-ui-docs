title: LazyImage
package: "@nature-ui/image"
description: "LazyImage component enables you to smartly load the images of your app by demand, using small placeholders (`fallbackSrc`) while the original image is being lazy loaded."
---

This component composes of
[react-intersection-observer](https://github.com/thebuilder/react-intersection-observer)
so it will only load an image as a page is scrolled.

## Import

```js
import { LazyImage } from "@nature-ui/core";
```

## Usage

```jsx
<Container size="xs" centered>
  <Stack spacing="8" col className="w-full">
    <LazyImage
      className="w-full h-96 object-cover"
      src="https://cutt.ly/qlcgXXE"
      fallbackSrc="https://cutt.ly/dlOXdEI"
      alt="burger 3"
    />
    <LazyImage
      className="w-full h-96 object-cover"
      src="https://cutt.ly/NlOZ0aT"
      fallbackSrc="https://cutt.ly/8lOZvYr"
      alt="burger 1"
    />
  </Stack>
</Container>
```
