To use Nature UI in your project, you need to first setup [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com):

### Install tailwindcss

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

### Install Nature UI

```bash
npm i @nature-ui/core
```

### Using Yarn

```bash
yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer.
yarn add @nature-ui/core@latest
```

After installing Nature UI, you need to set up `Tailwindcss` and `Postcss`. Run the following command to generate both configurations:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Finally, you need to update your `Tailwindcss` config file to include contents of `Nature UI` in the node modules.

```diff
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
+   "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
+   "./node_modules/@nature-ui/**/*.{js,ts}"
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
